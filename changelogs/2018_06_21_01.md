## Guidance for customers with issues checking out

To help resolve issue for customers checking out, the development team would recommend the following procedures:

1. Walk customers through the checkout process don’t simply check them out using the administrative backend
1. Find out exactly where the problem is occurring for the customer
1. Document the issue or if possible have the customer take a screen snapshot
1. Get the customer’s operating system and browser with version
1. Immediately complete a JIRA ticket or use SalesForce to create a JIRA ticket
